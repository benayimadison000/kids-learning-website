# 🌟 BetterKids Learning Games  
A Collection of Fun, Interactive, and Educational Games for Children  
Built with ❤️ by a Parent Using AI

## 📌 Overview
BetterKids Learning Games is a growing collection of **math**, **reading**, **logic**, and **fun arcade‑style games** designed to help children learn through play.  
Every game in this project was created with the help of **AI‑assisted development**, allowing rapid prototyping of creative, engaging, and kid‑friendly learning experiences.

This project started as a personal mission to support my children’s learning at home — and has grown into a full suite of browser‑based educational games that any child can enjoy.

All games run **fully offline**, require **no installation**, and work on **desktop, tablet, and mobile**.

## 🧠 Why I Built This
As a parent, I wanted learning tools that were:

- **Fun enough** to keep my kids engaged  
- **Educational enough** to reinforce real skills  
- **Accessible enough** to run anywhere  
- **Flexible enough** to customize for their needs  

AI made it possible to build dozens of games quickly, experiment with ideas, and create a playful learning environment at home.

This project is a reflection of that journey — blending creativity, technology, and parenting.
