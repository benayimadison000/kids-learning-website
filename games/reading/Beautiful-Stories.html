        <div class="story-body">
          <p>On a gray morning above a quiet town, a tiny raindrop named Kofi formed inside a floating cloud. He clung to thousands of other drops, all packed together in the cool, misty air. From his place near the edge, he could see the world below as a blur of colors—green fields, silver roofs, and a thin ribbon of river curling through the land.</p>
          <p>Kofi felt a tug downward as the cloud grew heavier, filled with more and more water. He remembered what older droplets whispered: when a cloud becomes too full, gravity gently pulls the drops toward the ground. Part of him was nervous about falling so far, but another part was excited to finally see the world up close.</p>
          <p>At last, the cloud could not hold him any longer, and Kofi began to fall. Wind rushed past him, cool and fast, guiding him in a soft, curved path instead of a straight line. As he dropped, he saw trees reaching up like open hands, roads shining with earlier rain, and children running for shelter, laughing as they dodged the showers.</p>
          <p>Kofi landed in a shallow puddle on a quiet street, joining other raindrops splashing and rippling together. For a while, he rested there, feeling the warmth of the ground slowly spread through the water. Then the sun peeked through the clouds, and light touched the puddle like a gentle invitation. Little by little, Kofi felt himself grow lighter.</p>
          <p>He began to rise, turning into invisible water vapor that drifted back into the air. The journey upward was slower than the fall, but it felt peaceful, like floating in a silent elevator made of warmth. High above the town, the vapor cooled and gathered with other droplets, and Kofi found himself inside a new cloud.</p>
          <p>From there, he could see a different part of the world—distant hills, a wider river, and fields he had never noticed before. He realized that he wasn’t just falling and rising without purpose. He was part of a long, patient cycle that carried water from sky to ground and back again, over and over.</p>
          <p>Kofi understood that his tiny life helped fill rivers, water plants, and cool the air on hot days. As he settled into his new cloud home, he felt a quiet pride. The world was big, and he was small, but together they moved in a rhythm that had lasted longer than any memory.</p>

        </header>

        <div class="story-body">
          <p>On a bright Saturday morning, a boy named Ebo stood in the schoolyard, watching his shadow stretch long across the concrete. It looked like a dark version of himself painted on the ground, thin and serious, with its head touching the edge of the soccer field. He raised one arm, and the shadow did the same, perfectly obedient.</p>
          <p>As the hours passed, Ebo noticed something strange. Without him moving at all, his shadow slowly slid to the side, shrinking and turning in a new direction. It was as if the shadow had changed its mind about where it wanted to stand. Curious, Ebo planted his feet and watched carefully, determined not to move a muscle.</p>
          <p>The shadow continued to shift, creeping closer to his shoes and then slipping behind him. His body had stayed in the same spot, but the sun had been traveling across the sky behind his back. His science teacher had said the sun does not truly move the way it seems; instead, the Earth turns, carrying everyone with it while the light angle changes.</p>
          <p>Ebo realized the shadow wasn’t acting on its own at all. It was simply tracing the path of sunlight as it hit his body from different sides. Each minute, the angle narrowed a little, making the shadow shorter and sharper. By noon, it hugged his feet like a dark puddle, barely stretching past his toes.</p>

        <div class="story-body">
          <p>On a dusty hillside far from town, a boy named Nana followed his geology club, carefully watching where he placed his feet. The ground was scattered with loose stones, each one worn smooth by years of sun, wind, and rain. To most people, the rocks all looked the same—gray and ordinary.</p>
          <p>Nana knelt to pick up a flat stone that had a faint, curved line running across it. At first, he thought it was just a crack, but when he brushed away the dust, he saw a delicate pattern: tiny ridges, repeating in careful arcs. It looked almost like the outline of a shell pressed into the rock.</p>
          <p>The group leader crouched beside him and smiled. It was not just a rock; it was a fossil, the preserved shape of a creature that had lived millions of years ago in a shallow sea. Over time, mud had covered the shell, hardened into stone, and guarded its memory while mountains rose and rivers carved valleys around it.</p>

          <p>In the school lab, a boy named Kwame built a small robot out of wires, wheels, and a shiny metal frame. He named it Lumo and gave it one simple job: follow the sound of a clapping hand. A tiny microphone on Lumo’s front acted as its ear, feeding signals into a little computer inside its body.</p>
          <p>When Kwame clapped on the left side, Lumo was supposed to turn left. When he clapped on the right, it should roll to the right. But during the first test, Lumo spun in confused circles, its wheels squeaking on the table. It seemed to hear something, but it could not understand what the sounds meant.</p>

          <p>Joel reached out and caught one in his palm. It was light as air, with a small, hard seed at one end and a delicate, curved wing at the other.

Curious, Nii placed the magnet on the table and watched closely as the particles quivered in a slow, steady rhythm, almost like a heartbeat.</p>
          <p>His teacher explained that the Earth itself acts like a giant magnet, and sometimes the planet’s magnetic field shifts just enough for sensitive materials to respond.

          <p>During a family trip to the desert, a boy named Kwaku climbed a tall sand dune just as the sun began to sink behind the horizon. The air was warm and still, and the dune stretched out beneath him like a giant golden wave frozen in place.</p>
          <p>As he slid a few steps down the slope, he heard a deep humming sound rise from the sand, low and musical, almost like a distant drum. Startled, he tried it again, and the dune responded with another soft vibration, as though it were singing back to him.</p>

          <p>In the middle of the school courtyard stood an old sundial, its metal gnomon casting a thin shadow across the stone surface. Most students ignored it, but a boy named Tetteh visited it every afternoon, fascinated by how something so simple could measure something as mysterious as time.</p>
          <p>One day, he noticed the shadow curve slightly instead of moving in a straight line, bending as though it were following a hidden path across the stone. Curious, he traced the curve with his finger and realized the sundial wasn’t broken — the Earth itself was tilting toward a new season, changing the angle of the sunlight.</p>

          <p>Adom tilted the mirror slightly, and the circle stretched into an oval, then a long streak of light that danced across the wooden boards. He realized he wasn’t just moving a reflection — he was bending sunlight itself, guiding it the way scientists direct beams in solar experiments.</p>

          <p>Yaw crouched down and touched the surface, surprised to feel a faint, steady movement even though the river looked almost still.
